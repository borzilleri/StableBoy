1.2.3
- Implemented functions for the "Cancel" and "Defaults" buttons in the Options UI. "Defaults" will reset your selections to the defaults, which is -EVERYTHING ENABLED-. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hopefully sqashed a bunch of bugs causing the Options UI to not update the status of checkboxes properly, and cause the selection to not affect the mounts used for random summoning. FauxScrollFrames can suck it.

1.2.2
- Fix a bug that would cause the Options UI to not update properly after learning a mount.
- Fix some typos/bugs with naming and parenting of the Flying Mount scroll frame.
- Fix a bug with the sizing of the Flying Mount Scroll frame.

1.2.1
- The Options panels now use a scrolling frame to display the mount checkboxes, showing a maximum of 15 checkboxes at once. This should avoid ugliness if you have a lot of mounts.

1.2
- Added the ability to filter which mounts are used for random selection. (Yes. I lied when I said I had no plans to do this. Sue me.)
- Added a UI in the Interface Options to select which mounts to use in the random selection. Note: This only allows you to select among your "best" mounts.
- Added slash commands to access the Interface Options panels: /stableboy, /stableboy ground, or /stableboy flying
- Significant internal code reorganization to hopefully make things more efficiant, easier to read, and easier to maintain.
